# Rhythm Game for Visually Impaired Children

## Overview

This project is an interactive rhythm game designed to enhance therapy sessions for visually impaired children. The game utilizes the Processing framework and Kinect SDK to create a multi-sensory, engaging, and dynamic experience that encourages active participation in therapy sessions. The game is played in an interactive room setting, where the movements of the children are captured by the Kinect sensor, converting physical actions into game interactions.

## Features

- **Kinect Integration**: The game captures players' movements using the Kinect sensor to provide a responsive and immersive experience.
- **Accessible Design**: Sound cues and visual elements are optimized for children with varying degrees of visual impairment.
- **Performance Tracking**: The game logs session data, including successful hits, missed nodes, accuracy, reaction time, and total playtime.
- **Session Summary**: At the end of each session, a summary is displayed, providing detailed insights into the player's performance.
- **Adjustable Node Speed**: Players can adjust the speed of the nodes during the game to match their comfort level.
